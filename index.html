                <p><I>This is the full legend of the Atom Master, <strong>Stephen Cephas</strong>, from the death of his
                        predecessor, Plathantos, to the day he left our known universe.</i></p>
                <p>Stephen Cephas is an astronaut from NASA in a new age program to find alien life in the galaxy. In
                    the year <strong>2032</strong>,
                    NASA has developed the technology to travel at <em>light speed</em> and decides to use Stephen as
                    the first captian to ever fly in life speed and, hopefully,
                    find alien life to communicate with. Only, he gets much more than he bargained for! More information
